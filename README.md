# Chest-Xray-Pneumonia-Detection

This project uses a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images, which are split into training, validation, and test sets. The images are preprocessed and augmented to improve model performance.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using TensorFlow. It includes several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and dense layers. The final layer uses sigmoid activation for binary classification.
